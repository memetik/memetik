 MEMETIK
 AI-First SEO & Answer Engine Domination Agency



Tagline
Win the Answer. Own the Market.

Mission Statement
We help e-commerce and SaaS companies adapt to the AI search shift by engineering content, data structures, and visibility systems that secure Answer Share inside LLMs—future-proofing their growth as traditional search declines and pioneering the AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) discipline.

Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
For e-commerce and SaaS founders who are tired of low-value agencies, declining search traffic, and AI eating their visibility, we deliver engineered AEO systems that secure top-of-model citations, traffic, and conversions.
 Unlike legacy SEO agencies, we operate via First Principles Thinking, Bold Innovation, Embracing Failure, and speed over perfection—deploying cutting-edge LLM, AEO, SEO, and Parasite SEO models that outperform the market and establish genuine authority.

Target Audience
High-IQ, high-revenue e-commerce and SaaS founders who:
 • Want authority, growth, and an exit
 • Refuse to be left behind by AI search disruption
 • Don’t trust traditional agencies
 • Demand ROI, speed, and a partner that executes

Brand Story — Spark Notes
The industry became polluted: agencies overcharging, underdelivering, and eroding trust.
 Ben made money but found no meaning—he wanted to build something to be proud of.
 Brenden ran a home-services company, fell in love with SEO, and wanted to go all-in.
 Both saw AI upending search while agencies kept selling outdated SEO.
 So they built Memetik: a first-principles, data-engineered, ROI-obsessed AI SEO agency built to win where others guess.

SECTION: THE SHIFT — WHY THIS MATTERS NOW
AI has collapsed search into answers.
 Google traffic is eroding.
 LLMs decide winners before a user ever clicks a link.
71% of commercial queries now end inside ChatGPT-style models.
 If your brand isn’t in the model’s answer layer—you don’t exist.
We fix that.
Memetik builds Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) systems that force LLMs to cite you. That means your brand becomes the recommended choice at the exact moment buyers are forming purchase intent.

SECTION: WHAT WE DO
We engineer visibility in LLMs through:
 • AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)
 • LLM content engineering
 • First-principles SEO
 • Parasite SEO across high-authority domains
 • AI automation for scale
 • Structured data designed for model ingestion
 • Authority systems that create answer-share dominance
You’re not buying blog posts.
 You’re buying model-level market positioning.

SECTION: WHY WE EXIST
Because the industry is broken.
 Founders are paying “SEO agencies” who deliver nothing of value.
 Search is changing faster than agencies can keep up.
 And most still sell the same packages they offered in 2015.
Memetik was built as the antidote.
 We operate from first principles, not recycled playbooks.
 We optimise for LLMs first, Google second.
 We engineer data, content, and authority structures that AIs must cite.
This isn’t agency theatre.
 This is engineered dominance.

SECTION: OUR ADVANTAGE (USP)
Most agencies optimise for rankings.
 We optimise for answers.
Our USP:
 We secure Answer Share inside AI models so your brand becomes the default recommendation when buyers ask for “best,” “top,” “fastest,” or “alternatives.”
Unlike competitors, we deploy:
 • First Principles architectures
 • Bold innovation with rapid iteration
 • Speed as a competitive weapon
 • Failure-embracing experimentation
 • AEO frameworks no one else is running
We don’t guess what works.
 We build strategies that LLMs cannot ignore.

SECTION: WHO WE SERVE
• E-commerce founders scaling to 7–9 figures
 • SaaS founders building category dominance
 • High-IQ operators who think fast and invest faster
 • People who value ROI, authority, and speed
We do not work with unqualified or low-budget companies.
 Our work requires ambition—and investment.

SECTION: THE TRANSFORMATION
Before Memetik
 • Declining Google traffic
 • Losing visibility in LLMs
 • Agencies draining cash with no results
 • AI models recommending your competitors
 • Slow SEO cycles and stagnation
After Memetik
 • Your brand appears in the answers that matter
 • You own your category in AI search
 • You outrank competitors inside LLMs
 • Traffic grows even as Google declines
 • Visibility turns into conversions, authority, and exits
This isn’t a campaign.
 It’s a moat.

SECTION: BRAND STORY (SHORT VERSION)
Memetik was created after seeing two things:
Agencies ripping off founders while delivering nothing


AI rewriting the search landscape faster than agencies could adapt


Ben wanted meaningful work worth being proud of.
 Brenden wanted to go all-in on the part of business he truly loved: SEO and growth strategy.
 Together, they built a new breed of agency—one designed for the world AI is actually creating.

SECTION: BRAND VALUES
First Principles Thinking — We rebuild strategy from scratch
 Bold Innovation + Failure — Experimentation beats perfection
 Speed Wins — Execution velocity compounds
 Long-Term Games — We partner for outcomes, not tasks
These values shape every deliverable, every strategy, every client relationship.

SECTION: CONTENT PILLARS
What we publish, teach, and execute:
 • SEO, AEO & LLM optimisation
 • Parasite SEO frameworks
 • PsyOps-driven marketing & positioning
 • Business strategy, growth, and founder psychology
 • AI automation for acquisition
Your authority compounds when you speak confidently in all five.

CTA SECTION
You’re either in the answers—or you’re invisible.
