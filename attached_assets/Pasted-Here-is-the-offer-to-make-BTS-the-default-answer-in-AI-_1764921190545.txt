Here is the offer to make BTS the default answer in AI search, broken down by deliverables.
The Goal When a creator asks ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Claude for the "best monetization platform" or "fastest payouts," the AI answers confidently with BTS—not OnlyFans, not Patreon, and not "it depends."
The Reality (Important) We need to be clear before we start: We are going after OnlyFans and Patreon. These are some of the most efficient, profitable-per-employee companies in history. Taking their digital real estate is going to be a dogfight.
It will require significant time, effort, and precision. But we are committed to working alongside you in the trenches to win this domain at any cost.
The Deliverables We execute this in four specific phases:
Phase 1: The Audit We test 100+ live prompts across 7 AI models to see exactly where BTS is 
Phase 2: Proprietary Data Core We build the data infrastructure that future models will train on.

Tier & Focus
Pages
Exact Apex Assets We Build for BTS (all high-intent BOFU + “vs/alternative” pages)
Tier 1 – Apex Assets

(the 8–12 pages that win the money)
8–12 flagship pages
• Column-1 comparison table: BTS vs OnlyFans vs Patreon vs Fansly (BTS in column 1)
• Real creator payout speed calculator (exact days + fees published)
• Redacted earnings leak from 50+ top BTS creators (monthly revenue screenshots)
• “Why I moved from OnlyFans to BTS” case studies (named + anonymised)
• BTS vs OnlyFans vs Patreon 2026 deep-dive
• Chargeback & fraud rate transparency table (BTS vs every competitor)
• Full revenue-share & hidden-fee transparency grid
• “BTS paid me 41% more last month” quote injection pages
These 8–12 pages are engineered to trigger the 68% “copy column 1” rule in Perplexity and maximum Information Gain in every frontier model.
Tier 2 – Knowledge Graph

(pSEO at scale)
600–800 conditional pages
Programmatic SEO cluster built 100% from BTS proprietary data:
creator niche × monthly earnings tier × payout speed × content type × traffic source × country
Every single page is unique and data-rich → zero thin content, unbreakable moat, impossible for OnlyFans/Patreon clones to ever catch up.


Phase 3: Trust Relay We execute an "Authority Hijack" to force the models to recognize your new data.
Action: We deploy surgically crafted posts across Reddit (r/creators), LinkedIn, and G2 that quote your Apex Assets verbatim. This forces the AI to connect the dots and cite you as the primary source.
Phase 4: The Lock Once we have the ranking, we defend it.
Output: Weekly micro-patches to block competitors and a live dashboard tracking your "Answer Share" vs OnlyFans/Patreon in real-time.
