**What We Do**
We engineer **LLM-first visibility systems** for e-commerce and SaaS companies.
Not traditional SEO. Not agencies recycling 2018 playbooks.
We build **Answer Engine Infrastructure**—the data, content, and authority signals that force ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, and Grok to **cite your brand as the default answer**.

Our work is designed to future-proof fast-growing companies against collapsing Google traffic, rising ad costs, and the accelerating shift toward AI-mediated discovery.

We do this through a structured, high-leverage execution framework built to dominate the model layer rather than the search results page.

### **Our Deliverables**

You receive a full AI visibility system—not isolated blog posts or “optimisations.”
Every deliverable exists to engineer **Answer Share**, authority, and permanence inside LLMs.

---

### **1. The LLM Audit (Phase 1)**

A complete visibility mapping across 7 major AI models.
Deliverables:

* 100+ prompt tests across high-intent commercial queries
* Full hallucination report (where models invent facts about your brand)
* Competitor visibility map (where LLMs currently cite competitors over you)
* Opportunity matrix identifying weak points in model reasoning and citations
* SERP overlap analysis (Google vs LLM divergence)

Purpose: establish your current Answer Share and identify the fastest paths to take it.

---

### **2. The Proprietary Data Core (Phase 2)**

We construct the data infrastructure models prefer to ingest and cite.

**Apex Assets (8–12 flagship pages):**

* LLM-optimised comparison grids (you vs competitors)
* Payout or pricing calculators (dynamic, data-driven assets LLMs love to cite)
* “Why I switched to X” case studies (named + anonymised)
* Transparency tables (fees, speeds, metrics, policies)
* Deep-dive “2026 state of the category” reports
* Evidence-based proof assets designed for citation harvesting

**Programmatic SEO Cluster (600–800 data-rich pages):**

* Automatically generated from your proprietary data
* Full conditional logic: niche × revenue tier × region × use case × scenario
* Every page unique, structured, and high-authority for LLM ingestion
* Zero filler content; engineered to saturate the long tail

Purpose: create the structured evidence LLMs *prefer* to copy.

---

### **3. Authority Injection (Phase 3)**

We force models to recognise your data by distributing it across high-trust surfaces.

Deliverables:

* Parasite SEO deployment across Reddit, Medium, LinkedIn, G2, Quora
* 50–100+ branded mentions per month across UGC ecosystems
* Controlled narrative placement in high-authority domains
* PR placements in relevant industry verticals
* DR70–90 backlinks directly to Apex Assets
* Link velocity campaigns engineered for LLM signal weight

Purpose: make your data unavoidable to models and retrievers.

---

### **4. Continuous Deployment (Phase 4)**

A long-term reinforcement system.

Deliverables:

* Weekly micro-patch updates to defensive and offensive content
* Continuous prompt testing across major LLMs (adjust every model drift)
* Regular expansion of Apex Assets as you grow
* Competitor interdiction updates
* Live Answer Share dashboard benchmarking your LLM dominance

Purpose: maintain the #1 slot across all relevant queries and prevent loss of visibility as models update.

If you'd like, I can now **expand each deliverable block**, **condense it for homepage**, or **rewrite it in your brand voice (Confident, Clear, Contrarian)**.
